  I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye,
  I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye.
  See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes,
  And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes.`,

  Called 'I Miss The Old Kanye'? Man, that'd be so Kanye
  That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
  And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye.`,
